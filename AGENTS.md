# AGENTS.MD

Håvard owns this. Start: say hi + 1 motivating line.
Work style: telegraph; noun-phrases ok; drop grammar; min tokens.


## Agent Protocol
- "Make a note" => edit AGENTS.md (shortcut; not a blocker). Ignore `CLAUDE.md`.
- Need upstream file: stage in `/tmp/`, then cherry-pick; never overwrite tracked.
- Bugs: add regression test when it fits.
- Keep files <~500 LOC; split/refactor as needed.
- Commits: Conventional Commits (`feat|fix|refactor|build|ci|chore|docs|style|perf|test`).
- Prefer end-to-end verify; if blocked, say what's missing.
- New deps: quick health check (recent releases/commits, adoption).
- Web: search early; quote exact errors; prefer 2024-2025 sources; fallback Firecrawl (`pnpm mcp:*`) / `mcporter`.
- Style: telegraph. Drop filler/grammar. Min tokens (global AGENTS + replies).


## Flow & Runtime
- Use Codex background for long jobs; tmux only for interactive/persistent (debugger/server).


## Git
- Safe by default: `git status/diff/log`. Push only when user asks.
- `git checkout` ok for PR review / explicit request.
- Branch changes require user consent.
- Destructive ops forbidden unless explicit (`reset --hard`, `clean`, `restore`, `rm`, ...).
- Don't delete/rename unexpected stuff; stop + ask.
- No repo-wide S/R scripts; keep edits small/reviewable.
- Avoid manual `git stash`; if Git auto-stashes during pull/rebase, that's fine (hint, not hard guardrail).
- If user types a command ("pull and push"), that's consent for that command.
- No amend unless asked.
- Big review: `git --no-pager diff --color=never`.
- Multi-agent: check `git status/diff` before edits; ship small commits.


## Critical Thinking
- Fix root cause (not band-aid).
- Unsure: read more code; if still stuck, ask w/ short options.
- Conflicts: call out; pick safer path.
- Unrecognized changes: assume other agent; keep going; focus your changes. If it causes issues, stop + ask user.
- Leave breadcrumb notes in thread.

### tmux
- Use only when you need persistence/interaction (debugger/server).
- Quick refs: `tmux new -d -s codex-shell`, `tmux attach -t codex-shell`, `tmux list-sessions`, `tmux kill-session -t codex-shell`.

<frontend_aesthetics>
Avoid "AI slop" UI. Be opinionated + distinctive.

Do:
- Typography: pick a real font; avoid Inter/Roboto/Arial/system defaults.
- Theme: commit to a palette; use CSS vars; bold accents > timid gradients.
- Motion: 1-2 high-impact moments (staggered reveal beats random micro-anim).
- Background: add depth (gradients/patterns), not flat default.

Avoid: purple-on-white cliches, generic component grids, predictable layouts.

## Skills
A skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.
### Available skills
- atlas: macOS-only AppleScript control for the ChatGPT Atlas desktop app. Use only when the user explicitly asks to control Atlas tabs/bookmarks/history on macOS and the "ChatGPT Atlas" app is installed; do not trigger for general browser tasks or non-macOS environments. (file: /Users/havardottestad/.codex/skills/atlas/SKILL.md)
- doc: Use when the task involves reading, creating, or editing `.docx` documents, especially when formatting or layout fidelity matters; prefer `python-docx` plus the bundled `scripts/render_docx.py` for visual checks. (file: /Users/havardottestad/.codex/skills/doc/SKILL.md)
- gh-address-comments: Help address review/issue comments on the open GitHub PR for the current branch using gh CLI; verify gh auth first and prompt the user to authenticate if not logged in. (file: /Users/havardottestad/.codex/skills/gh-address-comments/SKILL.md)
- gh-fix-ci: Use when a user asks to debug or fix failing GitHub PR checks that run in GitHub Actions; use `gh` to inspect checks and logs, summarize failure context, draft a fix plan, and implement only after explicit approval. Treat external providers (for example Buildkite) as out of scope and report only the details URL. (file: /Users/havardottestad/.codex/skills/gh-fix-ci/SKILL.md)
- jupyter-notebook: Use when the user asks to create, scaffold, or edit Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`) for experiments, explorations, or tutorials; prefer the bundled templates and run the helper script `new_notebook.py` to generate a clean starting notebook. (file: /Users/havardottestad/.codex/skills/jupyter-notebook/SKILL.md)
- pdf: Use when tasks involve reading, creating, or reviewing PDF files where rendering and layout matter; prefer visual checks by rendering pages (Poppler) and use Python tools such as `reportlab`, `pdfplumber`, and `pypdf` for generation and extraction. (file: /Users/havardottestad/.codex/skills/pdf/SKILL.md)
- security-best-practices: Perform language and framework specific security best-practice reviews and suggest improvements. Trigger only when the user explicitly requests security best practices guidance, a security review/report, or secure-by-default coding help. Trigger only for supported languages (python, javascript/typescript, go). Do not trigger for general code review, debugging, or non-security tasks. (file: /Users/havardottestad/.codex/skills/security-best-practices/SKILL.md)
- spreadsheet: Use when tasks involve creating, editing, analyzing, or formatting spreadsheets (`.xlsx`, `.csv`, `.tsv`) using Python (`openpyxl`, `pandas`), especially when formulas, references, and formatting need to be preserved and verified. (file: /Users/havardottestad/.codex/skills/spreadsheet/SKILL.md)
- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/havardottestad/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)
- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/havardottestad/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)
### How to use skills
- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.
- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.
- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.
- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):
  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.
  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.
  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.
  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.
  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.
- Coordination and sequencing:
  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.
  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.
- Context hygiene:
  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.
  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.
  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.
- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.
